# Relocation Navigator

Relocation Navigator is an interactive Streamlit app that helps users explore and understand neighborhoods before moving or traveling. It provides detailed, map-based insights on street slopes, land use patterns, and accessibility to key amenities using open geospatial data.

Powered by OpenStreetMap and OpenTopoData, the app visualizes:

- Street steepness to assess walkability and bike-friendliness

- Land use distribution (residential, commercial, parks, etc.)

- Proximity and walking distances to selected points of interest (schools, shops, public transport, etc.)

The app is still work-in-progress, so bugs and inefficiencies are expected.
